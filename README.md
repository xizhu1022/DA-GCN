This is the implementation of TOIS paper _Multi-Behavior Recommendation with Personalized Directed Acyclic Behavior Graphs_.

Message:

I am catching important deadlines, but I will definitely check the code and ensure it is released shortly after that, preferred by October 10. 

I appreciate your understanding and patience, and look forward to your continous attention to our work!
